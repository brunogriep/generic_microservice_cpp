# Software Architectures Patterns

| **Architecture**            | **Overview**                                                                 | **Implementation Details**                                                                                                 | **Pros**                                                                 | **Cons**                                                                  | **Examples**                                                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Microservices Architecture** | Independent deployable services with defined responsibilities                | Service decomposition, service registry, API Gateway, gRPC for communication, database per service                       | Flexible deployment, independent scaling, fault isolation                | Increased complexity, potential network latency and overhead              | **1.** E-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon)<br>**2.** Social media apps (e.g., Facebook)<br>**3.** Online banking systems (e.g., Capital One) |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Communication through events for scalability and decoupling                   | Event producers and consumers, event bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ), event sourcing                                         | Loose coupling, scalability, asynchronous processing                      | Complex event schema management, eventual consistency challenges           | **1.** Financial transaction processing (e.g., stock trading platforms)<br>**2.** Real-time analytics (e.g., Google Analytics)<br>**3.** IoT data processing (e.g., smart home systems) |
| **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** | Modeling based on business domains and their complexities                     | Bounded contexts, aggregates, repositories                                                                                  | Aligns with business needs, supports scalability and maintainability     | Requires thorough domain analysis, can be complex to implement            | **1.** Healthcare management systems (e.g., Electronic Health Records)<br>**2.** Logistics and supply chain management (e.g., DHL)<br>**3.** E-commerce platforms (e.g., Magento) |
| **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** | Reusable services providing business functions with integration focus         | Service contracts, ESB for integration, service governance                                                                 | Promotes reusability, leverages existing infrastructure                   | Can become complex, less emphasis on lightweight communication             | **1.** Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems (e.g., SAP)<br>**2.** Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems (e.g., Salesforce)<br>**3.** Travel booking systems (e.g., Amadeus) |
| **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** | Separates read and write operations into different models                     | Command model (write operations), query model (read operations), event store                                              | Optimizes read and write operations separately, improves performance      | Complexity in maintaining separate models, higher implementation effort    | **1.** E-commerce platforms (e.g., Magento with separate read/write models)<br>**2.** Financial systems with complex querying needs (e.g., trading platforms)<br>**3.** Real-time analytics dashboards (e.g., business intelligence tools) |
